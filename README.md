# Cinema_Provider_APP
this application is planned to be the first one that I will write in the Kotlin language (I previously wrote in java) and its essence is to create an intermediary 
application where you can watch movies, cartoons, etc.The application will consist of 5 main parts, with the exception of authorization , profile and other small things.
